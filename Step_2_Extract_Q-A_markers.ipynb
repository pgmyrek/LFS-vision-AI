    "### Step 2: Extract Q&A Markers and Save to Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "This step processes human-verified `.docx` files from Step 1 to extract structured Q&A content and save it in `.xlsx` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Workflow**:\n",
    "1. **Manual Processing**:\n",
    "   - Start with the file `Extracted.docx` generated in Step 1, located in the main directory.\n",
    "   - Open `Extracted.docx` and verify the content:\n",
    "     - Correct any misnumbered questions or truncated text.\n",
    "     - Ensure all questions start with \"Q\" and all answers start with \"A.\"\n",
    "   - Save the verified `.docx` file in the `Reviewed` folder with an appropriate name (e.g., `BGD.docx` for Bangladesh).\n",
    "2. **Automated Processing with Step 2 script**:\n",
    "   - Read `.docx` files from the `Reviewed` folder.\n",
    "   - Extract questions (starting with \"Q\") and their corresponding answers (starting with \"A\") using regex.\n",
    "   - Save the extracted content to an Excel file for each `.docx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Inputs**:\n",
    "- **Initial Input**: The `Extracted.docx` file from Step 1, located in the main directory.\n",
    "- **Final Input**: Human-verified `.docx` files, renamed and placed in the `Reviewed` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Outputs**:\n",
    "- `.xlsx` files containing structured questions and answers, saved in the `Reviewed` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Notes**:\n",
    "- Manual verification and cleaning of the `Extracted.docx` file is a crucial step before automated processing.\n",
    "- Ensure the verified `.docx` files are appropriately named (e.g., using country codes) before running this step.\n"
