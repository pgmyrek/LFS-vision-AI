    "### **Step 4: Inserting and Analyzing Data with a Vector Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Purpose**\n",
    "In this step, we use a **vector database** to store and query survey data semantically. This allows us to perform concept-based searches and retrieve records based on their meaning, rather than exact matches. The results are then analyzed with GPT-4 to generate insights about specific themes in national surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is a Vector Database?**\n",
    "A vector database organizes data as embeddingsâ€”numerical representations of text or other data types that capture their meaning. This enables **semantic searches**, where queries retrieve conceptually similar records, even if phrased differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What We Are Doing**\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and format survey data for insertion into the vector database.\n",
    "2. **Schema Definition**: Define a class (`questions`) to organize the data.\n",
    "3. **Data Insertion**: Add survey records, each represented by an embedding.\n",
    "4. **Semantic Search**: Query the database for themes (e.g., \"Maternity leave\").\n",
    "5. **Analysis**: Use GPT-4 to summarize and analyze the search results.\n"
